# Problem

I am trying to model a diffusion-reaction transport process based on a paper by Fu et.al
[](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10439-011-0336-z)
but fail to demonstrate mass is conserved for the system as a test of my implementation.

The paper simulates the release of a small molecule out of the top and bottom faces of a 
thin cylindrical polymer with no wall transport. Within the polymer cylinder, 
the molecule drug can either diffuse (LIGAND) or it can react reversibly  
with a non-diffusing host (COMPLEX). The resulting system of ode is solved with the method 
of lines. Since cylinders are symmetricals the system of equations is simplified 
to have no release from the bottom face and transport occurs only through the 
top face.

The model is used to simulate the cumulative release process out of the polymer cylinder. 
The paper by Fu implements the solution in matlab using ode15s and I would like to 
translate this approach to R using deSolve. I wanted to ask for your help answering
the following questions:

(1) Does the code below seems like a reasonable implementation of the model
in deSolve?
(2) Do you have any ideas why I may be experiencing a lack of mass conservation 
in the system? Wrong code, wrong implementation or other reason?

Any general suggestions or feedback is always appreciated. Thank you.

# The ode function
```{r}
affinity <- function(t, state , parms, ...){


# Extracting values passed onto the function through the state argument
  LIGAND     <- state[1:N]
  COMPLEX    <- state[(N+1):(2*N)]
  RELEASE    <- state[2*N+1]

# Initializing the derivatives vectors
  dLIGAND    <- rep(0, times = N)
  dCOMPLEX   <- rep(0, times = N)
  dRELEASE   <- 0

  
# Method of Lines  
  Rb         <- p1 * LIGAND * (p3 - COMPLEX) - COMPLEX

# Calculating the rate of change of the state variables

## This layer represents no transport in the bottom face 
  
  dLIGAND[1]   <- p2 * (LIGAND[2] - LIGAND[1]) / (delz^2) - Rb[1]
  
## This layer represents the polymer to solution interface
  
  dLIGAND[N-1] <- p2 * (-2*LIGAND[N-1] + LIGAND[N-2]) / (delz^2) - Rb[N-1]
  
## These are the calculations for the layers in between top and center
  
for(i in 2:(N-2)){
  dLIGAND[i]   <- p2 * (LIGAND[i + 1] - 2*LIGAND[i] + LIGAND[i-1]) / (delz^2) - Rb[i]
}
  
## Change in bound drug through the polymer cylinder
  dCOMPLEX     <- Rb

  dRELEASE     <- -(1/2)*p2*(LIGAND[N]-LIGAND[(N-1)])/(delz)


  dudt         <- c(dLIGAND, dCOMPLEX, dRELEASE)

ncall <<- ncall+1 

return(list(c(dudt))) 
             
  }

# When I sum both the drug remaining in the polymer and the drug entering the solution
# I expect a flat line around 1 (+/- numerical error) due to the principle 
# of mass conservation.However, I obtain a depletion curve.
